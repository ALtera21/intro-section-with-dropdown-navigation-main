## Overview

My biggest challenge yet, 3 days needed for it to be done. I need to learn how to make dropdown list and transistion side bar from scratch, it was hard.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

As my first junior level challenge, i somehow able to visualize the layout instinctively so making the layout in html feels like a flowing water. so of course like usual, layout first on mobile. But for this challenge i tried to finished off the mobile mode completly, with it's coloring and positioning of the elemnt, while moving onto the desktop mode, i can't think of other answer except using `display:none` on all mobile element, and creating a new element on html just for the desktop mode. It might make the code longer but i can understand it easier.

### Built with

- Semantic hmtl
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- no library
- no javascript

### What I learned

There are 2 main things i learned from this challenge:
1. make an transistion side bar 
2. making a dropdown list

It's not much, but for me, it is a huge leap

### Continued development

I want to learned more about dropdown list and transistion

### Useful resources

- [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - I think everyone should know how to use this website, it is like wikipedia made only for coding
- [getcssscan](https://getcssscan.com/css-box-shadow-examples) - i used this website to copypaste the shadow style
